# web-scraping-challenge

In this repo there is a jupyter notebook where you can view how data will be scraped from the web. This notebook was then converted into a python file which was used in our Flask application. 

The app provides a button that calls a function from the python file to scrape data from the web and then displays the grabbed data.
There are featured images, a table of information about mars and earth, and enhanced photos of Mar's hemispheres. 

Index.html provides the framework for the Flask application. 

Screenshots of the final applciation have been included in the screenshot directory.
